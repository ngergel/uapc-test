Usage: ./uatest.sh [options] <command> [-p problem] [file-name]

Note that the file only needs to be specified only the first time either 'test' or 'submit' is called.
If no problem id is specified, the problem id is infered from the file name. If the script has
been installed as a command, the command 'uatest' can be used instead of the script.

Futhermore, this script only supports C, C++, and Python 3.

Sub Commands:
 - 'clean' ........... Deletes test cases and problem meta data.
 - 'test' ............ Tests the file given against sample input. May download test cases if needed.
 - 'submit' .......... Submits the solution code remotely. Not enabled by default, see README for details.
 - 'install' ......... Installs the script sas the command 'uatest', which works in place of the script. The terminal may need to be restarted.
 - 'uninstall' ....... Uninstalls the command.

Options:
 - '-h', '--help' .... Prints this help message and exits.
 - '-o', '--output' .. When using the 'test' subcommand, print the output of the solution code.
 - '-p <problem>' .... Specifies the Kattis problem id to download test cases for/submit to.
 - '<file-name>' ..... Specifies the file to test with.
